$longText = "The history of artificial intelligence is a fascinating journey through the evolution of human thought about machines and cognition. From ancient myths of mechanical beings to modern deep learning systems, humanity has long dreamed of creating thinking machines. The field formally began in 1956 at Dartmouth College, where researchers gathered to explore the possibility that every aspect of learning could in principle be so precisely described that a machine could simulate it. Early AI systems focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based approaches. However, these methods struggled with the complexity of real-world problems. The neural network approach, inspired by the human brain, went through several cycles of enthusiasm and disappointment. Only in the past decade, with the advent of massive datasets and powerful computing hardware, have deep learning methods achieved remarkable success in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing."; Write-Host "Character count: $($longText.Length)"; Measure-Command { .\target\release\pocket-tts-cli.exe generate --text $longText --output test_very_long.wav --voice "D:\pocket-tts-candle\assets\ref_v2.wav" 2>&1 } | Select-Object TotalSeconds
