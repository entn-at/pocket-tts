            ## Pocket TTS v0.2.2 (Attention & Parity Fix)
            
            This release includes critical bug fixes for numerical parity and streaming stability.
            
            ### Key Changes
            - Fixed `StreamingMultiheadAttention` to handle large prefill batches (voice cloning fix)
            - Restored numerical parity with reference Python implementation
            - Decoupled quantization from CLI voice cloning
            - Improved CPU inference performance
            - Added web-based UI for live testing
            - Fixed CI/CD pipelines for cross-platform stability
            - Updated embedded assets bundling
